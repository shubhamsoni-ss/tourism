Chandigarh is the 1st planned modern city of India designed by the French a
-rchitect Le Corbusier. Chandigarh and the area surrounding it were constitu
-ted as a union territory on 1st November, 1966. It serves as the joint capital 
of both, Punjab and Haryana states. It is bounded on the north and west by 
Punjab and east and south by Haryana. Total area of the union territory is 
114Sq.Km.
The Chandigarh is located in north of India and surrounded by three states
 Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh. The Chandigarh city is situated in
 a picturesque setting under the foot of Shivalik Hills at a height of 365 met
-ers above the sea level. Geographically its boundaries are defined by two se
-asonal rivulets � the Patiali ki Rao and the Sukhna choe.

Chandigarh covers an area of approximately 114 km�. and shares its borders
 with the states of Haryana in the south and Punjab in the north. It has an av
-erage elevation of 321 meters (1053 feet).

The government is a major employer in Chandigarh with three governments
 having their base here. A significant percentage of Chandigarh�s population
 therefore consists of people who are either working for one of these govern
-ments or have retired from government service. For this reason, Chandigar
-h is often called a �Pensioner�s Paradise�.
